            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p> I am a recent graduate, with an Associate in Applied Science in
                Computer Programming & Development from Wake Technical Community College. My primary focus was in C++, though I am also
                comfortable with Python and Java, and have experience in IT and web design.
                I am currently seeking a job within the growing tech industry
                present in the Research Triangle, and I am eager to expand my
                scope of knowledge while demonstrating the skills I have picked up from
                my time with Wake Tech. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I have been partaking in some independent study and coding,
                and as a hobby I enjoy dabbling in game development. I would also consider
                myself to be a very family oriented individual, and I have been taking some time
                out of my schedule to assist family members in their own business ventures.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can be reached via LinkedIn, and I would appreciate any opportunity that comes my way.
            </p>
